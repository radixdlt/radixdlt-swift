## Features
⚠️👷🏾‍♀️ The Swift library is not production ready yet, it's under construction 🚜⚠️  

This is a **sneak peak** of the **coming** Application Layer API

### Radix Application

The `RadixApplicationClient` is the API layer this library exposes to you as a client developer. It allows you to create & transfer tokens, fetch balances and send messages.

```swift
final class RadixApplicationClient:
    AccountBalancing,
    TokenTransferring,
    TokenCreating,
    MessageSending
{ ... }

protocol TokenCreating {
    func createToken(action: CreateTokenAction) throws -> PendingTransaction
}

protocol TokenTransferring {
    func transferTokens(action: TransferTokensAction) throws -> PendingTransaction
}

protocol AccountBalancing {
    /// `AddressConvertible` is a protocol for something that can return a Radix `Address` (`Address` conforms to `AddressConvertible`, returning `self`).
    func observeBalances(ownedBy owner: AddressConvertible) -> AnyPublisher<TokenBalances, Never>
    func observeBalance(ofToken tokenIdentifier: ResourceIdentifier, ownedBy owner: AddressConvertible) -> AnyPublisher<TokenBalance?, Never>
}

protocol MessageSending {
    func sendMessage(_ message: SendMessageAction) throws -> PendingTransaction
}
```

### Usage

Here are some example usages. The code below is an excerpt of an existing the unit test [`TransferTokensTests.swift`](https://github.com/radixdlt/radixdlt-swift/blob/develop/Tests/TestCases/Radix/0.%20Layer%207%20-%20APPLICATION%20(Transactions%2C%20Balances)/TransferTokensTests.swift)

#### Create Token

```swift
let aliceIdentity = AbstractIdentity()

let application = RadixApplicationClient(bootstrapConfig: UniverseBootstrap.default, identity: aliceIdentity)

/// A Radix `Address` is dependent on `RadixUniverse` of the `RadixApplicationClient`. Betanet, Alphanet, Mainnet are examples of different Universes.
let alice: Address = application.addressOfActiveAccount

/// Alice defines her own token, resulting in a tuple, where first parameter is the pending result of the action,
/// the second is the Radix Resource Identifier (RRI) of the newly created token. The RRI uniquely identifies Alice's coin
/// having this format:  "/<ALICE_ADDRESS>/AC", "AC" matching the `symbol`
let (result, rriAliceCoin) = application.createToken(name: "Alice Coin", symbol: "AC", description: "Best coin", supply: .fixed(to: 30))
assert(rriAliceCoin == "/\(alice)/AC")
```

#### Get token balance

```swift
let bob: Address = application.addressOf(account: Account()) 

var alicesBalanceOfHerCoin = application.observeMyBalance(ofToken: rriAliceCoin)
var bobsBalanceOfAliceCoin = application.observeBalance(ofToken: rriAliceCoin, ownedBy: bob)

assert(alicesBalanceOfHerCoin.amount == 30, "Alice's balance should equal `30`(initialSupply)")
assert(bobsBalanceOfAliceCoin.amount == 0, "Bob's balance should equal `0`")
```

#### Transfer tokens

```swift
// Alice sends 10 coins to Bob
application.transferTokens(
    identifier: rriAliceCoin, 
    to: bob, // `from` address defaults to the identity passed in th e
    amount: 10, // type`PositiveAmount`, conforming to `ExpressibleByIntegerLiteral`
    message: "For taxi fare" // Optional
)

alicesBalanceOfHerCoin = application.observeMyBalance(ofToken: rriAliceCoin)
bobsBalanceOfAliceCoin = application.observeBalance(ofToken: rriAliceCoin, ownedBy: bob)

assert(alicesBalanceOfHerCoin.amount == 20, "Alice's balance should equal `20`")
assert(bobsBalanceOfAliceCoin.amount == 10, "Bob's balance should equal `10`")

```

#### Send Message
```swift
// `application` is initialzed above using Alice's identity
application.sendEncryptedMessage("Hi Bob, this is a secret message from Alice", to: bob)

// Plain text messages (i.e. no encryption) can be sent like so
application.sendPlainTextMessage("Hi Bob (and the world) from Alice", to: bob)

// You can even include some third parties to be able to read the encrypted message
let carol: Address = application.addressOf(account: Account()) 
let diana: Address = application.addressOf(account: Account()) 


application.sendEncryptedMessage(
    "Hi Bob! Carol and Diana can also decrypt this encrypted message", 
    to: bob,
    canAlsoBeDecryptedBy: [carol, diana]) 
)
```

## Getting started

### 0. Install Xcode 11

Install it from the [App Store](https://itunes.apple.com/gb/app/xcode/id497799835?mt=12).

**Make sure that you have a simulator installed**, by starting Xcode - agree to Terms and Conditions and install any additional dependency if needed - navigate to *Settings -> Components* and verify that you see at least one installed *iPhone Simulator* in the list.

#### Xcode Settings

Enabling parallel builds (if your computer has lots of RAM)
```bash
defaults write com.apple.dt.Xcode BuildSystemScheduleInherentlyParallelCommandsExclusively -bool NO
```

Showing build times in order to reduce it by focusing on complex code
```bash
defaults write com.apple.dt.Xcode ShowBuildOperationDuration -bool YES
```

### 1. Clone this repo
```bash
git clone git@github.com:radixdlt/radixdlt-swift.git && cd radixdlt-swift
```

### 2. Install `brew`
```bash
/usr/bin/ruby -e "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Homebrew/install/master/install)"
```

#### Issues?
[See brew troubleshooting page](https://docs.brew.sh/Troubleshooting)

### 3. Install `carthage`
```bash
brew install carthage
```

**Make sure that you have version 0.32 or later installed, otherwise it will not work with Xcode 10.2**

#### Issues?
If that command says that Carthage needs **linking** (maybe it was already installed but not linked) with a permissions error similar to the one below:
```bash
Warning: carthage 0.32 is already installed, it's just not linked
You can use `brew link carthage` to link this version.
$ brew link carthage
Linking /usr/local/Cellar/carthage/0.32... Error: Permission denied @ dir_s_mkdir - /usr/local/Frameworks
```

Then you can fix that by running:
```bash
sudo mkdir -p /usr/local/Frameworks && \
sudo chown -R $(whoami) /usr/local/Frameworks && \
brew link carthage
```

Which makes sure that your current user is owning that directory, therefore `brew link` can **sudoless** - which is needed. For more info about this issue, [please refer to this Gist](https://gist.github.com/irazasyed/7732946).

### 4. Install `swiftlint`
```bash
brew install swiftlint
```

#### Issues?
If you have any issues [go to swiftlint repo](https://github.com/realm/SwiftLint)


### 5. Install dependencies using Carthage
Please make sure that your **current directory is the _root of the repo_** (as per previous instructions).
```bash
carthage bootstrap --platform iOS --cache-builds
```

#### Issues?
If that fails you might need to install some additional tools:
```bash
brew install autoconf automake libtool pkgconfig wget
````

Which suggests adding some exports in your shell profile, try:

```bash
export LDFLAGS="-L/usr/local/opt/openssl/lib"
export CPPFLAGS="-I/usr/local/opt/openssl/include"
export PKG_CONFIG_PATH="/usr/local/opt/openssl/lib/pkgconfig"
```

### 6. Run tests
Open the project:
```bash
open RadixSDK.xcodeproj
```

In Xcode run the tests by pressing `CMD` + `U`, verify that everything is working. 

## Architecture

### Stack
Some rough, inaccurate attempt to map components within this library to the [OSI Model](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/OSI_model)
to help with understanding of the different layers and trying to ease separation of concern.

#### Layer 1 - Subatomic
Serialization and deserialization, cryptography and subatomic parts, making up the particles and also other low level DTO's such as `HexString`, `Base58String`.

## Design choices

### Why Carthage?
As of 2019-01-14, [BitcoinKit doesn't build using Cocoapods](https://github.com/yenom/BitcoinKit/issues/193). But it works fine using Carthage.

### Why RxSwift based APIs?
First of all, all the existing Radix Libraries are Rx based, secondly because it makes perfect sense since it makes async programming easy.

## Dependencies

You will find the dependencies in the [Cartfile](Cartfile), but we will go through the most important ones here:

- [BitcoinKit](https://github.com/yenom/BitcoinKit):
Elliptic Curve Cryptography, this library is one of the better Swift wrappers of the C library [bitcoin-core/secp256k1](https://github.com/bitcoin-core/secp256k1).

- [CryptoSwift](https://github.com/krzyzanowskim/CryptoSwift):
For standard crypto utilities such as hash functions.

- [BigInt](https://github.com/attaswift/BigInt):
Support for big numbers.

- [RxSwift](https://github.com/ReactiveX/RxSwift):
The library uses RxSwift for async programming.
